# What is AppForge?

AppForge is a modern enterprise admin platform built with **Spring Boot 4** and **Vue 3**, designed for teams that want a production-ready management system with the latest Java and frontend technologies.

## Why AppForge?

Most open-source admin frameworks in the Java ecosystem are stuck on older stacks — Spring Boot 2.x, Java 8, and Webpack-based frontends. AppForge takes a different approach: start fresh with the newest stable releases and apply clean architecture from day one.

### Core Highlights

- **Spring Boot 4.0.5 + Java 21** — virtual threads enabled by default for massive concurrency without reactive complexity
- **GraalVM Native Image** — optional ahead-of-time compilation for ~100ms startup and ~50MB memory footprint
- **Vue 3 + Vite 8** — instant HMR, tree-shaking, and TypeScript-first frontend development
- **Clean Architecture** — domain-driven multi-module Gradle project, not a monolithic `src/` dump
- **Flyway Migrations** — version-controlled schema management instead of manual SQL scripts
- **Real-time Server Monitoring** — CPU, memory, JVM, and disk metrics via Oshi, viewable in the admin panel
- **Dual Docker Deployment** — choose between Native Image (fast startup) or JVM (easy debugging)
