# User Management

The user management module provides complete CRUD operations for system users, including department-based filtering, status control, password management, and role assignment.

## Features

- User list with pagination, search, and department tree filter
- Create / edit / delete users
- Enable / disable user accounts
- Reset user passwords
- Assign roles to users
- Department-based organization

## Data Model

The `SysUser` entity (`sys_user` table) contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| userId | Long | Primary key (auto-increment) |
| username | String | Login username (unique) |
| nickname | String | Display name |
| email | String | Email address |
| phone | String | Phone number |
| sex | Integer | Gender (0: female, 1: male) |
| avatar | String | Avatar URL |
| password | String | BCrypt-hashed password |
| status | Integer | Account status (0: disabled, 1: enabled) |
| deptId | Long | Department ID (foreign key) |
| remark | String | Notes |
| createTime | DateTime | Creation timestamp |
| updateTime | DateTime | Last update timestamp |

## API Endpoints

### Admin API (`AdminApiController`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|

### RESTful API (`SysUserController`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/system/user` | List all users |
| GET | `/system/user/{id}` | Get user by ID |

## Department Tree Filter

The user list page includes a department tree on the left side. Clicking a department node filters users belonging to that department and its children. The tree data comes from the `SysDept` entity.

## Password Security

- Passwords are encrypted with **BCrypt** before storage
- The frontend encrypts the password with **RSA** (using the server's public key) before transmitting
- The server decrypts with the RSA private key, then hashes with BCrypt
- The RSA private key is configured in `arch-smith.rsa-private-key`

## Service Layer

The `SysUserService` and `UserService` classes handle business logic:

- Username uniqueness validation
- Department existence check
- Default role assignment on creation
- QueryDSL-based dynamic filtering (`SysUserPredicates`)
